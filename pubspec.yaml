# To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
# assets:

#
# For details regarding assets in packages, see

# in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
# "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
# list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
# example:
